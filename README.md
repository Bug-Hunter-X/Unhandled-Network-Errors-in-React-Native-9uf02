# Unhandled Network Errors in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common issue and its solution related to unhandled network errors in React Native applications.  The `bug.js` file showcases a basic implementation that lacks comprehensive error handling, while `bugSolution.js` provides an improved version with more robust error handling.

## Issue

The original code doesn't thoroughly handle potential network errors.  This can result in unexpected behavior, crashes, or incomplete data updates, especially when dealing with unreliable network conditions.

## Solution

The improved solution addresses this by adding more comprehensive error handling, including checks for HTTP status codes, network timeouts, and JSON parsing errors. It provides more informative error messages to improve debugging and user experience.
